  title: "Bendin' Tube | 1972 Ford Maverick",
  description: "This house call was a great way to put our Rogue Fabrication tubing bender to work, while helping preserve the interior of this 1972 Ford Maverick. The existing weld in cage that was ordered did not allow for installation of the back seats, but with a couple of extra bends added, the seats and interior panels will both fit without issue once the cage is fully welded in place. It might not look like much, but once the car is complete, that cage will be essential-with a hopped up 302 under the hood pushing over 7x the factory rated horsepower, it'll finally have the power to get out of its own way for the first time since ’72! Stay tuned for more updates, something tells us this is just the first of many fab-related house calls we will be doing for this perfectly preserved gem of a ’70s American engineered shitbox.",
